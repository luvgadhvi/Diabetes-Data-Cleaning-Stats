# Diabetes Data Engineering Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview
This project delves into the Diabetes dataset from the UCI repository, covering data from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008. By applying advanced data engineering techniques, the analysis aims to uncover underlying patterns and provide insights that could significantly influence future healthcare strategies. This comprehensive approach not only seeks to enhance data quality but also to understand key factors influencing diabetes management and readmission rates.

## Objectives
- **Deep Dive into Relationships**: Utilize extensive plotting to map out complex relationships within the data, providing a clearer understanding of the dynamics at play.
- **Predictive Insights**: Focus on identifying key predictive attributes, particularly 'readmitted', to aid in forecasting patient outcomes and understanding factors influencing readmission.
- **Data Quality Enhancement**: Implement rigorous data cleaning processes to address missing values, outliers, and redundancies, thereby improving the overall integrity and usability of the dataset.

## Files
### diabetes_data_engineering_part_1.py
- **Attribute Visualization**: Extensively visualize each attribute to understand its distribution and interrelationships.
- **Target Attribute Analysis**: Focuses on 'readmitted' as a potential target for prediction, examining its characteristics and predictive value.

### diabetes_data_engineering_part_2.py
- **Missing Data Strategy**: Analyzes patterns of missing data (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and develops strategies for handling them effectively.
- **Attribute Importance**: Uses statistical methods to evaluate the significance and impact of each attribute, prioritizing those that offer the most value.
- **Correlation and Redundancy Analysis**: Identifies and eliminates redundant attributes to streamline the dataset.

### diabetes_data_engineering_part_3.py
- **Advanced Data Cleaning**: Discusses and implements strategies for outlier handling and missing data imputation, with justifications for each approach.
- **Transformation Techniques**: Applies necessary transformations to prepare the data for final analysis.
- **Validation through Re-Analysis**: Conducts a thorough re-analysis post-cleanup to ensure the robustness of the data modifications.
- **Comprehensive Data Profiling**: Each attribute is detailed with its statistical profile, transformations applied, and its role in the overall analysis.
